instructions how to run

on your vs code, open terminal cd until xampp htdocs, and git clone my repository (im assuming you have github installed) run these:

git clone https://github.com/cyrus998/animates.git

create a database named "animates" (on your xampp or whatever you are using lmao)

cp .env.example .env                          (to create the env)

composer update
